1) Set parameters
Open the script and adjust the two lookback settings to the number of hours you want for long- and short-term analysis (the variables named SHORT_TERM_HOURS and LONG_TERM_HOURS).

2) Generate and inspect the CSV
Run the “scan” portion of the tool to produce a CSV of only those symbol pairs that cointegrate on both timeframes. Locate that CSV on your Desktop, open it in your spreadsheet program, and note the Index values of the rows (pairs) you’re interested in.

3) Visualize a pair
Launch the script’s “visualize” workflow. When the tool prompts you in the terminal, type the Index number you noted and hit Enter. Your normalized-price and spread chart for that pair will appear.
